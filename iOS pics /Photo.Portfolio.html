    <h1> The Lazy Grass</h1>
    <!--Description-->
    <h3> I took this photo while laying in the middle of a meadow.</h3>
    <!--Why I like It-->

    <!--Caption-->
    <h1> Max on the Beach</h1>

    <!--Description-->
  <h3> This is a photo that I took of a tree after a snowstorm.</h3>
    <!--Why I like it-->

    <h3> This is a photo that I took on the beach before the sunset. </h3>
    <!--Why I like it-->
    <h3> I love the way the sun is the main point of the photo but the reflection of the sun on the sand is
    also a very eye catching part of the frame. I love the background/environement of this frame.</h3>

    <h1> Half and Half</h1>
    <!--Description-->
    <h3> I took this picture when I was kayaking on a lake in Poland. <h3>
    <!--Why I like it-->

    <!--Caption-->
